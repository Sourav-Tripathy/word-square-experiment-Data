*`Okay, so I need to build a 5x5 word square where all the rows and columns are valid English words. Hmm, word squares can be tricky because each row must read the same down the columns. Let me think about how to approach this.*`

`*First, I remember that a word square of size 5 means that the first row's first letter is the start of the first column, the second row's first letter is the start of the second column, and so on. So each row i must have its j-th character equal to the i-th character of row j. That's a bit confusing, but maybe if I break it down step by step.*`

`*Let me start by thinking of 5-letter words that have letters that could potentially form other words when read vertically. For example, the first row is a word, and then each subsequent row has to start with the corresponding letter from the first column. Maybe starting with a common vowel in the first position might help. Words starting with 'A' are common, so maybe that's a good starting point.*`

`*Let's try the first row as "ANGER". Then the first column must start with A, N, G, E, R. So the second row starts with N, the third with G, fourth with E, fifth with R. Now I need the second row's word to start with N, and its second letter must be the second letter of the second column. Wait, the second column's letters are the second letters of each row. So if the first row is ANGEL (maybe that's a better word?), the second column would be N, ?, ?, ?, ?. Hmm, maybe choosing the first word is crucial here.*`

`*Alternatively, maybe looking for words that have common letters in certain positions. For example, the word "HEART" could be a possible first row. Then the second row needs to start with E, and the second letter would be the second letter of the second column. But this might not be straightforward.*`

`*I recall that some word squares use words like "HEART", "EMBER", "RESIN", "TRAIN", "NIGHT" but I'm not sure if that works. Let me check:*`

`*Row 1: H E A R T*`

`*Row 2: E M B E R*`

`*Row 3: A B O R E*`

`*Row 4: R E E T S*`

`*Row 5: T R E S T*`

`*Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check the columns. Column 1 would be H, E, A, R, T (HEART), which is good. Column 2: E, M, B, E, R (EMBER) – that works. Column 3: A, B, O, R, E (ABORE) – is that a word? Abore isn't a valid word. Maybe "ABODE" or something else. Hmm, that's a problem.*`

`*Alternatively, maybe "HATES" as the first row. Let's see:*`

`*Row 1: H A T E S*`

`*Row 2: A B O R E*`

`*Row 3: T O N E S*`

`*Row 4: E R E E T (not a word)*`

`*Row 5: S E T T S (invalid). That doesn't work.*`

`*This trial and error might not be the best approach. Maybe I should look for existing 5x5 word squares. I remember that some examples exist, but I need to verify if all the words are valid.*`

`*Another approach: start with a word that has a lot of common letters. Let's try "LATIN". Then the next row starts with A, and the second letter must be the second letter of the second column. So row 2 would start with A, and the second letter is the second letter of row 2. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me structure it better.*`

`*In a 5x5 word square:*`

`*Row 1: W1 W2 W3 W4 W5*`

`*Row 2: W2[1] W2[2] W2[3] W2[4] W2[5]*`

`*Row 3: W3[1] W3[2] W3[3] W3[4] W3[5]*`

`*Row 4: W4[1] W4[2] W4[3] W4[4] W4[5]*`

`*Row 5: W5[1] W5[2] W5[3] W5[4] W5[5]*`

`*But each column i must be the word formed by the i-th letters of each row. So column 1 is W1[1], W2[1], W3[1], W4[1], W5[1] which must form a valid word, and similarly for columns 2-5.*`

`*So for example, if the first row is "HEART", then column 1 is H, E, A, R, T (HEART), which is good. Then column 2 is E, (second row's second letter), etc. So row 2 must start with E, and the second letter must be the second letter of column 2, which is the second letter of row 2. Wait, that's confusing. Let me see: column 2's letters are the second letters of each row. So row 1's second letter is E, row 2's second letter is the second letter of column 2's word, which must be the same as the second letter of row 2's word. So row 2's word starts with E (since column 1's second letter is E from row 2), and the second letter is part of the column 2's word. Hmm.*`

`*Maybe another way: Let's suppose the first word is "ANGEL". Then column 1 must be A, N, G, E, L. So row 2 starts with N. Let's say row 2 is "NURSE". Then column 2's letters would be N (from row1), U (from row2), ... but wait, column 2's first letter is row1's second letter, which is N. Then column 2's word would be N, U, ?, ?, ?. But row2's second letter is U, which becomes the second letter of column 2. Then column 2's word is N, U, ..., so maybe "NURSE" as row2 would have column2 starting with N, U, R, S, E. Wait, "NURSE" is N U R S E. So column2 would be N U R S E, which is "NURSE" – that's a valid word. But then row2 is "NURSE", which starts with N, which is the second letter of row1 (A N G E L). So column1 is A, N, G, E, L (ANGEL), column2 is N, U, R, S, E (NURSE). Then row3 must start with G, and the third letter of row3 must be the third letter of column3. Wait, column3's first letter is G (from row1's third letter), then column3's second letter is R (from row2's third letter), so column3 would be G, R, ?, ?, ?, which needs to form a valid word. If row3 is "GRACE", then column3 would be G, R, A, C, E (GRACE), which is valid. Then row3 is G R A C E. Then column3 is GRACE. Then row4 must start with E (from row1's fourth letter), and the fourth letter of row4 must be the fourth letter of column4. Column4 starts with E (row1's fourth letter), then S (row2's fourth letter), then C (row3's fourth letter), so column4 is E, S, C, ?, ?. The word could be "ESCUE" but that's not a valid word. Alternatively, "ESCAR" but that's not a word. Hmm, this is getting complicated.*`

`*Alternatively, maybe a known 5x5 word square exists. Let me think. I recall that one possible 5x5 word square is:*`

`*H E A R T*`

`*E M B E R*`

`*A B U S E*`

`*R E S I N*`

`*T R E N D*`

`*Let's check this. Column1: H, E, A, R, T (HEART) – valid. Column2: E, M, B, E, R (EMBER) – valid. Column3: A, B, U, S, E (ABUSE) – valid. Column4: R, E, S, I, N (RESIN) – valid. Column5: T, R, E, N, D (TREND) – valid. And the rows:*`

`*Row1: HEART – valid*`

`*Row2: EMBER – valid*`

`*Row3: ABUSE – valid*`

`*Row4: RESIN – valid*`

`*Row5: TREND – valid*`

`*That works! All rows and columns are valid English words. Let me double-check each:*`

`*Rows:*`

1. `*HEART – correct.*`

2. `*EMBER – yes.*`

3. `*ABUSE – yes.*`

4. `*RESIN – yes.*`

5. `*TREND – yes.*`

`*Columns:*`

1. `*H, E, A, R, T – HEART.*`

2. `*E, M, B, E, R – EMBER.*`

3. `*A, B, U, S, E – ABUSE.*`

4. `*R, E, S, I, N – RESIN.*`

5. `*T, R, E, N, D – TREND.*`

`*Yes, this seems to work. All words are valid and have meanings. So this would be a correct 5x5 word square
